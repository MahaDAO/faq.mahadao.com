# I have a marketing proposal. Who do I reach out to?

If you are a vendor/influencer/business who would like to pitch their services to MahaDAO, we would suggest you to share your proposal on our official mail - [marketing@mahadao.com](http://mailto:marketing@mahadao.com/)

We at MahaDAO abstain from carrying out marketing/influencer related activities unless we see extreme benefit in it for the overall MAHA community. If you indeed think, that your services will be valuable to the wider MAHA community, do reach out to us via mail.
