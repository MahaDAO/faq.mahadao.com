# What are the fiat currencies ARTH is pegged to?

ARTH is a next-generation digital currency designed to tackle the depreciation of government-owned currencies \(like US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan\), but at the same time remain relatively stable \(unlike Gold and Bitcoin\).

ARTH does this by being pegged to a basket of assets that represent strong hedges of each other.

The unique peg of ARTH looks like this:

* 80% — Collection of Fiat currencies
* 15% — Gold \(often considered a safe-haven asset
* 5% — Bitcoin \(also started to show properties of being a safe have asset as of recently\)

The Fiat currencies include:

* USD,
* GBP,
* INR,
* JPY,
* CNY,
* CHF,
* CAD\)
