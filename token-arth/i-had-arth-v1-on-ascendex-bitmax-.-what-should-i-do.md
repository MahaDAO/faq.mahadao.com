# I had ARTH v1 on AscendEX \(Bitmax\). What should I do?

The core team has procured a list of users with their ARTH v1 balances.   
  
The team will airdrop ARTH v2 tokens and the said tokens will be automatically added to the Debt pool.   
  
To know more about the Debt pool, check this question\(link\).
