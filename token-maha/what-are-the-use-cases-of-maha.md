# What are the use cases of MAHA?

$MAHA is an incredibly unique token. Its use cases can be summed up as:

* **Governance** - The MAHA token is the single most imp token in the MAHA ecosystem. It will govern all the products that go live today, tomorrow and 10 years down the line in the MahaDAO ecosystem. As the products within the ecosystem gain more popularity and adoption, the MAHA token will prove to be further valuable.
* **Incubation allocation** - As a project that will incubate various other sister projects, the MAHA holders receive a special allocation to participate in the private sales of these projects.
* **Token burn** - Because, MAHA is a limited supply token, every token burnt creates a further reduction in supply. These burning mechanisms are manifold, some can be seen in products that charge transaction fees in MAHA.
